`roachdb`

simple database for education. Supports only cli mode.

`Features`:
* Supports only one table, i.e. not RDBM.
* Table is not fixed, i.e. you can specify your own
  names and data types for table. Currecnlt supports
  integer and string data types.
* Save content into table and download it from file.
* Supports few SQL queries: create table, select, delete,
  show, exit, etc.

`TODO`:
1) Add more features from SQL langiage.
2) Optimize import/export functions.
3) Make code more clean and modular.
